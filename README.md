# 1.2 Problem Description
- Masjid do not have any specific platform or any apps that can help ustaz or ustazah for question and answer sessions.  

- 1.2.1 Background
- In traditional ways, question and answer session be held using microphone or using paper if they want to ask question. This way doesn’t give an equal opportunity in asking the questions, especially for introvert person. To this kind of person, they need to organize their word well and it is hard for them to do it when people looking at them. So, they cannot deliver their question well.
- 1.2.2 Problem statement
-Using paper is one of the solutions, but percentage of peoples nowadays carry their smartphone is higher than peoples who brings paper anyway they go. Sometimes they do not have a piece of paper and a pen to write down their question. There are some apps that may be use, but that apps are seem complicated and complex for some novice user such as old people, people who has low computer background.

- List of Problem:
1.	People difficult to ask question using microphone or using paper. Maybe the microphone far from them or they do not have paper at that time to right their question.
2.	Application already in market mostly in paid version, complicated and complex for novice user.
3.	Does not have any specific application yet for masjid.

# 1.3 Project objective

1.	To help introvert people ask questions easier.
2.	To make question and answer session in masjid more efficient and faster.
3.	To develop a specific application or platform for masjid use.
4.	To ease novice user using computer technology in their life.
5.	To help ustaz or ustazah to receive question from audience easier and store it safely
6.	To help place their announcement easier and attract more people to view the announcement.

# 1.5 Constraints
Basically, we will encounter problems of how to put the right information of the masjid. Then we will be having hard time to connect our app to the GPS system. Time and skill that we have also becomes part of our constraint. Due to that constraint, we eliminate the gps function for locating all nearby masjid and just focus on a masjid only.
# 1.6 Project Stages
During the development of the project, there are several stages that are required to be completed before proceding to the next stage. In the design phase, the layout of the application will first be designed using sketches to get basic understanding of how the application will look like. Next, we can proceed to the development phase where 2 major milestones are carried out in parallel, the coding of the app layout and the programming of the functions of the app. This is achieved by assigning the task to pairs;one pair of team members design the layout while the other pair code the functions. The progress of the project can be tracked through the Gantt chart.
